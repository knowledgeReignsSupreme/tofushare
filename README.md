This app makes it simple for people to share their own vegan recipes.
<br />
Simply put, this is a mini-social platform that allows people to: <br />

- Create and edit their profile
- Create and edit as many recipe as one would like
- View other's profile which has bio info, created and cooked recipes etc.
- A user can mark a recipe as cooked (adds to the recipe's counter which is displayed on the recipe page and calculated on the author's total counter).
- Comment on recipes
- Save recipes
- View and change the ammount of dishes in each recipe
